## 2025.9.1

## Todo

Expanded moderation tools added (log sender IP, if logged in user id) and allow site admins and users themselves to ban senders. 
Server lockdown mode that doesn't let any new asks come in and closes registrations.

Notifications to admins when a new user is awaiting approval. Notification filtering.

Allow admins to send announcements that appear as a bar for everyone. Allow admins to send notifications to individual users.

Mastodon autopost support. In the future, likely Misskey and maybe Bluesky.

Frontend touchups. Need to fix font not being respected by buttons and other elements. Make a settings page instead of having everything be under "edit profile".
Allow selecting all users & all invites on the settings pages.

## Done
